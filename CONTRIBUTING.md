# Reading code
The code can be a bit hard to read with most of it being compressed together. If you feel unable to read the code, feel free to seperate the code out. 

## Creating good issues
In the main folder, there is a log.txt file. This file is generated before and after step one. 

If you have an issue, check the log.txt file to see if you can fix the error yourself. 

Otherwise, if it is a bug, you'll want to report it on the issues tab on GitHub. 

**IMPORTANT**: When uploading your log.txt file, please remove any sensitive information like keys or emails, if applicable.
